I want to build a Quora Question Scraper and Auto Answer Generator using Python.

This app will do the following:

---

1. ✅ SCRAPING SYSTEM

- This will **not be built from scratch here** — I’ll be importing an external Python scraping script that can take in:
  - A **keyword** (e.g., “mental health”, “startup ideas”)
  - An optional **time filter** like "past week" or "past month" (if the scraper supports it)
  - A number `n` (like 20 or 30) to specify how many questions to fetch

➡️ So in Replit:
- Create a **Flask or FastAPI app backend** where I can trigger that external Python script
- Accept input from the user via a frontend or form:
  - Keyword
  - Time filter (dropdown: None / Past Week / Past Month)
  - Number of questions to fetch

- The script will return a **list of questions and their URLs**. Use dummy data for now in the format:
```json
[
  { "question": "How can I improve focus?", "link": "https://quora.com/..." },
  ...
]
✅ AI ANSWER GENERATION

After questions are displayed, let the user select which ones they want to generate answers for

Use Google Gemini API (or allow me to plug in any other free LLM API) to generate the answers

Format should be:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "question": "...",
  "answer": "...",
  "link": "..."
}
➡️ For now, mock the Gemini output using a simple response like "Answer generated by AI."

✅ EXPORT TO PDF

Once AI answers are ready, provide an option to download them all as a formatted PDF

Each page or section in the PDF should have:

Question

Answer

Link to original Quora post

➡️ Use reportlab or any other Python PDF library.

✅ FRONTEND (Optional)

Provide a simple frontend (React or plain HTML+JS)

Three views:

Input page to enter keyword + number of questions + time filter

Results page showing scraped questions

Generate answers + Download PDF page

Keep the UI simple for now, focus on backend logic.

✅ EXTRA NOTES

Build in a way that lets me plug in my own scraping script via a Python module (e.g., from quora_scraper import scrape)

Allow the scraping and answer generation to be asynchronous or show a loading spinner

Structure folders cleanly: scraper/, api/, utils/, templates/ (if using Flask), static/ (for CSS/JS)

Goal: This base version should run on Replit and allow me to:

Input keywords

Scrape questions (via external script)

Generate AI answers (via Gemini or dummy)

Export as PDF

I will integrate the real scraper script and real Gemini API later. Please scaffold the system to allow this easily.

## 🔧 After Replit Generates Code
Once Replit creates the basic scaffolding:
- Replace the **scraper function** with your actual external script (usually a `scrape(keyword, time, limit)` function).
- Add the **real Gemini API call** in place of dummy responses (you can also ask me to help you with the exact Gemini integration).
- Ensure that the `flask` or `fastapi` app runs with all dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

---

Would you like me to generate the actual **file structure** and **starter code template** for this as well? I can give you:
- `main.py` with Flask setup
- `scraper.py` placeholder
- `ai_utils.py` for answer generation
- `pdf_generator.py` for export
Let me know!







You said:
can you change the prompt to:

i also want the user to select a topic like suppose i defined child in keywords, that doesn't mean it should find everything related to children.. i should be able to select a topic like mental health, business, etc. to pin it down to the core. topic will also act as a keyword but it'll be universal that in addition to the keywords it'll only find questions related to the topic.

Frontend is not optional.. it should be react based.
rest looks fine, can you give me the complete prompt too like in one single script


ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! Here's your complete and updated AI prompt in one clean script. It includes the topic-based filtering logic, clarifies how topics and keywords interact, and enforces that the frontend must be React-based.

I want to build a Quora Question Scraper and Auto Answer Generator using Python and React.

🧩 This app should work as follows:

---

### 1. ✅ SCRAPING SYSTEM (BACKEND)

I will be using an **external Python script** to scrape Quora data. You don’t need to build the scraper logic from scratch — just make the system modular so I can plug in a script like:
```python
def scrape_questions(topic, keyword, time_filter, limit):
    # returns list of { "question": ..., "link": ... }
The backend should be a Flask or FastAPI server that:

Accepts user input:

A Topic (like "mental health", "business", "relationships", etc.)

This acts as a broad context filter

A Keyword (like "child", "startup", etc.)

This should be searched within the context of the topic

A Time filter (None, Past Week, Past Month)

Number of questions (limit: default 20–30)

🔁 Logic:

The topic will act as a global context, and the scraper should ideally only find questions related to that topic + keyword

If the external script doesn’t support that, simulate it now using filtered dummy data

The script should return a list like:

json
Copy
Edit
[
  { "question": "How can I raise a mentally strong child?", "link": "https://quora.com/..." },
  ...
]
Store this temporarily in memory or backend state.

2. ✅ AI ANSWER GENERATION
After the user receives the scraped questions, allow them to select which ones they want AI-generated answers for.

Use Google Gemini API (or any other free LLM API I provide later). For now, just create a dummy generate_answer(question) function that returns:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "question": "...",
  "answer": "This is a sample AI-generated answer.",
  "link": "..."
}
✅ Make this part pluggable so I can add my own real Gemini API key and logic later.

3. ✅ EXPORT TO PDF
After answers are generated, provide an option to export all answered Q&As into a formatted PDF.

Each section of the PDF should contain:

✅ Question

✅ AI-generated Answer

✅ Link to the original Quora question

Use any Python PDF library (reportlab, fpdf, pdfkit, etc.) and make the export feature available in the UI.

4. ✅ FRONTEND (REACT MANDATORY)
Create a React-based frontend that communicates with the backend via API routes.

It should include:

1️⃣ Input Page:
Topic (input or dropdown)

Keyword

Time Filter (dropdown)

Number of questions to fetch (number input)

Fetch Questions button

2️⃣ Results Page:
Display scraped questions

Allow user to select which ones they want to generate answers for

3️⃣ Answer Generation Page:
Show selected questions with generated AI answers

Show a Download as PDF button

💡 You may use axios or fetch to call backend routes from React.

5. ✅ FOLDER STRUCTURE SUGGESTION
Please keep the folder structure modular:

csharp
Copy
Edit
root/
│
├── backend/
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── scraper.py          # External script plug-in
│   ├── ai_utils.py         # Gemini integration or mock
│   ├── pdf_generator.py    # PDF creation logic
│   ├── requirements.txt
│
├── frontend/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── pages/
│   │   └── App.jsx
│   ├── public/
│   ├── package.json
│
├── README.md
6. ✅ NOTES
Assume I’ll be replacing the dummy scrape_questions() and generate_answer() with real ones later

Make everything modular and readable so it’s easy to plug in real APIs and scripts

Keep styling simple for now — focus on full functionality

Final result: A working full-stack app (React + Flask/FastAPI) that:

Accepts input

Scrapes Quora using external logic

Generates AI answers

Exports a nicely formatted PDF

Please scaffold the entire system in a way that runs in Replit, including replit.nix or poetry setup if needed for backend dependencies.
